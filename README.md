## Licensing

This package is offered under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.0. See the [GPL3](./LICENSE) for details.

⚠️ Note: when using the public `git` repository, you will find a reference to a separate project (`raw-assets`). While that repository is available to the public, it is **not** covered by the GPL3 license. The contents of that package are not included in the built package that can be installed via `npm` or `yarn`. Given the licensing complexity of those contents (most of they are based on third-party intellectual properties), there is no plan to publish them on the npmjs.com or any other package registry.
