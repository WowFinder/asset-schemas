# WowFinder assets

⚠️ **Note:** this repository is likely to undergo some restructuring in the near future, to make licensing much simpler. We intend to keep as much of it as we can under free and open licenses, but there are unavoidable dependencies on third-party IPs that need to be studied very carefully. See the Licensing section below for deeper details of what you can safely use at the moment.

## Repository status

Due to the upcoming split of the repository, assume everything here is unstable and subject to change without notice.

Because the repository is currently "private", Sonar analysis for it is not available. Coding in this repository will follow the same standards as other repositories in the project, but the ability to automatically review and enforce them is currently unavailable.

## Licensing

The built package, as well as any source necessary to build them, is available under the [GPL3 license](GPL3.txt). Content under the assets folder in the repository is pending in-depth review (note that this content is **not** included in built packages).
